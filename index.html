    <h1>Welcome. This webpage is designed using the javascript library <a href="https://interactjs.io/">'Interactjs'</a></h1>
    <h2>It allows you to manipulate objects including: dragging, dropping, resizing and even supports multi-touch gestures for modern browsers and devices.</h2>

    <p>Clicking the button below will allow you to play a small matching game with a twist.</p>
    <p>Using your curser scratch away the color until you find some shapes.</p>
    <p>Two shapes will be identical. If you drag and drop them together the shapes and color will change, and you start again.</p>
    <p>One of the identical shapes is a key and the other is a lock. The lock will have a border after you find it.</p>
